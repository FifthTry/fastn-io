Fastn is powered by a one of a kind design system guiding the overarching framework. It has been carefully constructed to imbibe & maintain design considerations right through development & implementation. The framework is consistent and spans across all our component libraries.

FastN has an expansive ever-growing color library. It places no restriction when it comes to color palettes or color combinations unlike some design systems. Because it has been incrementally built by designers for developers, FastN color libraries provide an array of compatible options for developers to skin & re-skin their creations to their heartsâ€™ content.
